## 1. Repeat and check homework
## 2. Testing levels and boxing

Testing levels:
1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. System tests
4. UAT/E2E

Unit and integration tests performed by developers
System, E2E, UAT by QA.

UAT - user acceptance tests
alfa tests - by QA team (realize candidate)
beta tests by customer's team

BE - backend
FE - frontend

White box:
All tests arranged by coding
- unit and integration tests
- require BE

Gray box:
- we understand validation based on app code.
- System testing require BE.
- E2E require FE (UI/UX)

Black box:
- require FE (UI/UX)
- E2E, UAT
- System testing require BE (POSTMAN, newman) with REST API style

## 3. Software dev. methodologies: Waterfall, Agile

SDLC - software development lifecycle
STLC - software testing lifecycle

PO - project owner

Product nad project companies

Requirements:
1. Customer requirements
2. System requirements
3. Programming specification

build v0.0.1
> registration fn

build  v0.0.2
> registration fn (old)
> fixed bugs
> login fn

build  v0.0.3
> registration fn (old)
> login fn (old)
> fixed bugs
> item catalog fn

Waterfall: Linear and sequential. Each phase (e.g., Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testnig → Maintenance) must be completed before the next begins.

Agile: Iterative and incremental. Development is done in small cycles (sprints), and features are delivered continuously.

Testing
> Waterfall: Testing happens after development is complete.  
> Agile: Testing happens continuously during dev
